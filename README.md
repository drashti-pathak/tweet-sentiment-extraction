# TEAM DOCUMENTATION FOR TWEET SENTIMENT EXTRACTION

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
```
given the tweet the task is to select a part of the tweet which conveys the sentiment of the tweet as neutral, positive or negative.
```

## PLAN OF ACTION
```
    1. Explore basic of NLP
    2. Explore the dataset and analyse the problem statement
    3. Explore and understand the public notebooks on kaggle and then select the model which suits the team well
    4. Make some changes to the model and then evaluate the model with those changes
    5. Try other variations of the language model 
    6. Understand the innner workings so that suitable  modifications can be made to the head of the model to increase our score
```
## WORK/STUDY DONE TILL NOW
```
Steps 1 to 4 in above course of action have been completed. Currently we are on the 5th step.

* [word2vec](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf)

## FUTURE PLAN IN NEXT 10 DAYS
```
Exploring other variations of BERT  and other language models such as XLNet and trying to apply them to the current problem statement
